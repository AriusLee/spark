                </div>
                <p>Customers can share the offer on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, email, and more in just a few clicks. They don&#8217;t even have to write anything. Making it easy ensures everyone who wants to share actually does. That&#8217;s why we generally see 20-60% of customers sharing the offer in one or more places.</p>

                </div>
                <p>After the friend clicks the link, they see a landing page that explains the deal your customer gave them. It also has a discount code and countdown timer. By building trust, making the offer easy to use, and creating a sense of urgency, Curebit-referred friends are more likely to purchase than other shoppers.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Once a friend buys, we send your original customer a Thank You email along with a reward for their loyalty. The friend unlocks a fresh offer to share with the people they care about, and the referral cycle starts over.</p>
