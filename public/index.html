                    <p>Post-purchase offers are shared at a very high rate, because customers are most enthusiastic about your brand right after purchase.</p>

                <p>Customers can share the offer on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, email, and more in just a few clicks. They don't even have to write anything. Making it easy ensures everyone who wants to share actually does. That's why we generally see 20-60% of customers sharing the offer in one or more places.</p>

By building trust, making the offer easy to use, and creating a sense of urgency, Curebit-referred friends are more likely to purchase than other shoppers.</p>
